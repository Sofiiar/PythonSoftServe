# Task 10
1. In your branch `feat/<yourname>`.
    ```bash
    # pull into your branch latest changes (commits) from `main`
    git pull origin main
    ```

2. Create python program which accepts `sequence of numbers` and prints `sorted list` to console in `sort_numbers.py`.
    ```bash
    # Input: 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2
    # Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```
    Note, the numbers should not be sorted as numbers (not strings)

3. Commit your changes.
    ```bash
    git add week_2/homework/task_10/sort_numbers.py
    git commit -m "sort numbers (task 10)"
    git push
    ```
