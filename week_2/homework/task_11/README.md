# Task 11
1. In your branch `feat/<yourname>`.
     ```bash
    # pull into your branch latest changes (commits) from `main`
    git pull origin main
    ```
2. Create python program which accepts `sequence of characters` and prints list of each third element to console in `each_third.py`.
    ```bash
    # 3, 2, 1, 4, 5,  2, ss, q
    # ['3', '1', '5', 'ss']
    ```
    Note, the input sequence may contain blank spaces around values, but output list should not have spaces!
3. Commit your changes.
    ```bash
    git add week_2/homework/task_10/each_thirs.py
    git commit -m "each third (task 11)"
    git push
    ```
