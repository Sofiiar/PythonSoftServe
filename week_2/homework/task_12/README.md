# Task 12
1. In your branch `feat/<yourname>`.
    ```bash
    # pull into your branch latest changes (commits) from `main`
    git pull origin main
    ```

2. Create python program which accepts `sequence of characters` and `splits it on 2 (mostly) equal parts` to console in `equal_parts.py`.
    ```bash
    # 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, ,  2, ss, q
    # ['3', '2', '1', '4']['5', '2', 'ss', 'q']
    ```
    Note, parts may not be exactly equal if it's not possible!

3. Commit your changes.
    ```bash
   git add week_2/homework/task_12/equal_parts.py
   git commit -m "equal parts (task 12)"
   git push
    ```
